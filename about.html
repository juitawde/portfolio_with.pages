          <h2>About me</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Hi, I’m Jui, an aspiring web developer with a strong passion for creating clean, aesthetic, and user-friendly digital experiences. I enjoy working with HTML and CSS to build visually pleasing websites that focus on thoughtful layouts, pastel color palettes, and smooth interactions.</li>
            <li>Alongside front-end development, I have hands-on experience with Python, where I’ve worked on projects such as an Employee Leave Trend Visualizer that analyzes and presents data in a clear and meaningful way.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy building practical solutions using Google Sheets and no-code tools, including a Marina Boat Reservation Dock system that simplifies booking and data management.</li>
            <li>My learning journey began with creative platforms like Scratch, which helped me develop logical thinking and a strong foundation in problem-solving through interactive projects.</li>
            <li>I love exploring new tools, experimenting with ideas, and continuously improving my skills while transforming concepts into functional and visually engaging projects.</li>
            <li>My goal is to keep learning, building, and growing as a developer while creating digital experiences that are both purposeful and aesthetically appealing and land up in a big firm taking over big responsibilities with care.</li>
          </ul>
